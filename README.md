## Summary
*Addictions* follows a dysfunctional Nicotine Anonymous group led by Elise, a woman who presents herself as a support figure while privately continuing to smoke and manipulate the members. The narrative is driven by the group’s fragile dynamic and an escalating series of deaths, starting with the murder of Sebastian, one of the group members, and later the suspected suicide of another member, Karie. As the group begins to unravel, suspicion and paranoia grow, particularly centered around Arbor, a quiet woman with a traumatic past and a history of sex work and drug use.

The story blends psychological drama with mystery and horror. Elise, the narrator and group leader, gradually reveals herself to be an unreliable and dangerous figure. While she speaks in support-group platitudes, she is emotionally detached and, eventually, revealed to be orchestrating or at least capitalizing on the group’s collapse. After Leon—referred to as the “golden boy”—is murdered and a severed, ornamented arm is sent to Arbor in a parcel, Arbor is lured to Elise’s apartment. There, Elise goads Arbor into confessing to Sebastian’s accidental murder (which occurred when Arbor, acting on trauma-induced panic, stabbed someone who startled her in the dark).

Elise admits to murdering Karie and Leon, framing her actions as symbolic tributes to Arbor, with whom she is obsessed. The final confrontation becomes a mix of seduction, psychological manipulation, and violence. Elise, wanting Arbor to kill her, ultimately forces Arbor's hand, plunging the knife into her own chest in a theatrical act.
